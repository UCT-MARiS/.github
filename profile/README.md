# UCT MARiS

Welcome to the UCT MARiS GitHub Organization. This is a collection of repositories and other GitHub tools for the UCT MARiS Centre.

## About

**MARiS** (Marine and Antarctic Research for Innovation and Sustainability) is the new interdisciplinary centre for Marine and Antarctic Science projects, involving multiple departments within the University of Cape Town: Biological Sciences, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Oceanography.  

The centre is an aggregator of competence and expertise that considers academic and technological knowledge in relation to societal benefits, with the overarching aim of enhancing the production of knowledge and human capacity in marine and Antarctic research.  

Our main objectives are:

* Collaborate with national and international research projects;
* Support students and their integration into the academic environment, particularly supporting interdisciplinarity to address complex problems in interconnected marine systems;
* Develop technological and innovative solutions to interdisciplinary marine problems and for extreme conditions like the polar environment;
* Promote and maintain post-graduate training courses, including interdisciplinary curricula such as the Applied Ocean Sciences Master course;
* Contribute to national programmes and infrastructure (e.g., DST SARIR programmes such as BIOGRIP, SAPRI)
* Serve as a single marine entry point to UCT, facilitating interactions with stakeholders and potential partners.

## Research

The MARiS Centre is structured around inter-related science foci:

1. Antarctic and Southern Ocean Research,
2. Marine Research on the southern African margin, and
3. Innovation in Chemical, Materials and Observational Engineering.
